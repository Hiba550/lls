# RSM Rework Flow Fix - Test Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Navigation Issue
**Problem**: After RSM assembly rework, the system navigated to `/assembly/rsm` instead of the main Assembly Dashboard at `/assembly`.
**Fix**: Modified `rsm.js` line 1302-1309 to navigate to `/assembly` instead of `/assembly/rsm`.

### 2. Data Loading Issue
**Problem**: The Assembly.jsx didn't load rework orders from localStorage keys (`workOrders`, `pendingWorkOrders`, `pendingAssemblies`) where RSM backend saves them.
**Fix**: Enhanced Assembly.jsx useEffect (lines 98-176) to load from these localStorage keys and merge with API data.

### 3. Rework Field Consistency Issue
**Problem**: RSM backend set `reworked: true` but Assembly.jsx checked for `is_rework`.
**Fix**: Modified RSM backend to set both `is_rework: true` and `reworked: true` for consistency, plus added `rework_tag`.

## Test Plan:

1. **Complete an RSM Assembly**:
   - Navigate to RSM assembly page
   - Complete an assembly to move it to completed list

2. **Send Assembly to Rework**:
   - Go to completed assemblies 
   - Click "Rework" on an RSM assembly
   - Fill out rework reason and confirm

3. **Verify Expected Behavior**:
   - âœ… System should navigate to `/assembly` (main dashboard)
   - âœ… Rework order should appear in pending assemblies list
   - âœ… Rework order should have an amber "Rework" tag
   - âœ… No navigation to `/assembly/rsm` should occur

## Files Modified:

1. `frontend/src/js/rsm.js` - Fixed navigation target
2. `frontend/src/pages/Assembly.jsx` - Enhanced data loading from localStorage
3. `frontend/src/js/rsm_backend.js` - Fixed rework field consistency

## Key Changes:

1. **RSM Navigation**: 
   ```javascript
   // OLD: window.location.href = '/assembly/rsm';
   // NEW: window.location.href = '/assembly';
   ```

2. **Assembly Data Loading**: Added localStorage loading for rework orders:
   ```javascript
   const localStorageKeys = ['workOrders', 'pendingWorkOrders', 'pendingAssemblies'];
   // Load and merge with API data
   ```

3. **Rework Field Consistency**:
   ```javascript
   const reworkEntry = {
     ...assembly,
     is_rework: true,        // Added for Assembly.jsx compatibility
     reworked: true,         // Existing field
     rework_tag: 'ðŸ”„ REWORK REQUIRED'  // Added visual indicator
   };
   ```

The rework orders should now:
- Be created via API and stored in localStorage
- Appear in the main Assembly Dashboard at `/assembly`
- Display with proper rework tags
- Not trigger navigation to RSM-specific pages
